				<h2>Author Bios</h2>
				<h3>Sarah Young</h3>
				<p>Sarah was a postdoc in Digitalisation and AI, focusing on quantum technologies in the department of Media and Communication at Erasmus University Rotterdam during the writing of this article. She is now a lecturer in the College of Information Science at the University of Arizona. She studies the technical and science communication of emerging technologies as well as their social impacts, particularly on privacy and surveillance, and technology's implications for humans, ethics, justice, policy, and standardization. Her monograph <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoar.suny.edu%2Fhandle%2F20.500.12648%2F8546&data=05%7C02%7Ctmdavis%40arizona.edu%7C957fcb4017944b10a03908dcfaa761d0%7C5ee35505eb8e4929937d645df5013288%7C1%7C0%7C638660844012492006%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=A3pVAyup9JyOg3e3TqTGwcJCAMlnMBKcyKHxhfWyDPY%3D&reserved=0">Working through Surveillance and Technical Communication</a> is open access.</p>
				
				<h3>Simone Driessen</h3>
				<p>Simone Driessen is an assistant professor in Media and Popular Culture at the Erasmus School for History, Culture and Communication, Erasmus University Rotterdam. Her research interests are fans’ continued engagement and disengagement, following a controversy or cancellation, with their object-of-fandom. Additionally, she examines how popular culture can offer a lens to understanding science. She does this on three Horizon-funded projects on trust in science and science communication including the TRESCA project. She published in a.o. <em>American Behavioral Scientist, Convergence, and Participations</em>, and is co-editor of <em>Participatory Culture Wars: Controversy, Conflict and Complicity in Fandom</em>.</p>
				
				<h3>Jason Pridmore</h3>
				<p>Jason Pridmore is an associate professor in the department of Media and Communication at Erasmus University Rotterdam. Jason coordinates the COALESCE project, focused on the development of the European Competence Centre for Science Communication which builds on his previous experience leading TRESCA and several sister science communication projects within the European Union. In addition, he leads the SEISMEC project, focused on human centric industry. Focusing on effective (data) science communication effective alongside the integration of new digital practices in the workplace, Jason‘s work crosscuts the intersections of technology development, social science research, and educational and communication practices in understanding how digitalisation has altered our everyday life experiences. </p>
